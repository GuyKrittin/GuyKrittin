# 👋 Hello there, I'm Krittin Siangprasertkij

🎓 I’m a recent graduate with a Bachelor of Engineering in **Information and Communication Engineering** from the **International School of Engineering, Chulalongkorn University**.

💻 Over the past few years, I’ve had the opportunity to grow as a developer through internships and research:
- **Software Engineer Intern @ Agoda** – Built scalable backend systems with production-level code.
- **Quantum Computing Student Researcher Intern @ National Pingtung University** – Explored quantum annealing.
- **Backend Developer Intern @ Playtorium** – Contributed to backend system development.

I love building useful applications, optimizing systems, and learning new technologies. Most of my projects are focused on backend development, real-time systems, and full-stack product building.
